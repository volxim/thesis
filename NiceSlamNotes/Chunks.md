We present NICE-SLAM, a dense RGB-D SLAM system
that is real-time capable, scalable, predictive, and robust
to various challenging scenarios.



The core of NICE-SLAM is a hierarchical, grid-based
neural implicit encoding. In contrast to global neural
scene encodings, this representation allows for local up-
dates, which is a prerequisite for large-scale approaches.
