**Thinking about the goal:**
I explain the paper, its goal, terms, math and concepts in simple language to different target groups:
Child.
A reasonable person who does not know about computer stuff.
Applied Computer Science Student, like me.

Recall this every time i dig into the paper.

i) At the end i understand the paper.
ii) I can formulate the expos√© for the thesis.
