`create a markdown table template which i can fill out in regard to the levels of understanding`

| Level of Understanding | Description | Your Explanation / Example |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 1. Recognition         | Can identify or has heard the term; no real understanding. |                             |
| 2. Definition          | Can provide a dictionary-style definition or basic meaning. |                             |
| 3. Explanation         | Can explain the concept in their own words and give a simple example. |                             |
| 4. Application         | Can use the concept correctly in context (e.g., writing, code, experiments). |                             |
| 5. Analysis            | Can compare, critique, or analyze the concept in different contexts. |                             |
| 6. Synthesis           | Can extend or creatively apply the concept to novel situations or combine it with others. |                             |

| Level of Understanding | Description | Helper Questions | Your Explanation / Example |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1. Recognition         | Can identify or has heard the term; no real understanding. | - Have I seen or heard this term before?<br>- Where did I come across it? |                             |
| 2. Definition          | Can provide a dictionary-style definition or basic meaning. | - What does the term literally mean?<br>- How would I define it in one sentence? |                             |
| 3. Explanation         | Can explain the concept in their own words and give a simple example. | - How would I explain this to a non-expert?<br>- Can I give a simple real-world analogy or example?<br>- What problem does it help solve? |                             |
| 4. Application         | Can use the concept correctly in context (e.g., writing, code, experiments). | - How is this term used in practice?<br>- Can I describe a scenario where I used it?<br>- Whatâ€™s a typical use case? |                             |
| 5. Analysis            | Can compare, critique, or analyze the concept in different contexts. | - How does this term relate to or differ from similar concepts?<br>- What are its strengths and limitations?<br>- In which contexts does it perform best or worst? |                             |
| 6. Synthesis           | Can extend or creatively apply the concept to novel situations or combine it with others. | - How can I combine this concept with another idea?<br>- Can I apply it to a new or unconventional domain?<br>- How might I improve upon or generalize it? |                             |

| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Recognition         | Can identify or has heard the term; no real understanding.                                | "I've seen this term in machine learning papers."                                                            |
| 2. Definition          | Can provide a dictionary-style definition or basic meaning.                               | "Assumptions a model makes to predict outputs."                                                              |
| 3. Explanation         | Can explain the concept in their own words and give a simple example.                     | "It's like a model's built-in guesswork that helps it learn faster."                                         |
| 4. Application         | Can use the concept correctly in context (e.g., writing, code, experiments).              | "We used CNNs because their spatial inductive bias suits image data."                                        |
| 5. Analysis            | Can compare, critique, or analyze the concept in different contexts.                      | "Transformers lack certain biases that CNNs have, which can affect performance on visual tasks."             |
| 6. Synthesis           | Can extend or creatively apply the concept to novel situations or combine it with others. | "We created a hybrid model that mixes spatial and temporal inductive biases to improve video understanding." |
